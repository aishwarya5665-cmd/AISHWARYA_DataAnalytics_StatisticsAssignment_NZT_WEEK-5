**PROJECT OVERVIEW**
**STATISTICS AND ANALYTICS TECHNIQUES**
**Dataset Used** StudentScores, Employee_Salary, Sales_Marketing, Health Data

**Dataset Description**
Multiple datasets were used: student scores, employee salary, sales & marketing, and health data. 
These datasets contain numerical and categorical variables suited for statistical analysis, probability, correlation, regression, and hypothesis testing. 

**Task 1 – Descriptive Statistics**
Mean = 70.6, Median = 72, Mode = 72, Range = 59, Standard Deviation = 16.51. A histogram of Math Scores displays overall distribution.

**Task 2 – Probability Analysis**
Department & Probability 
Marketing 0.248 
HR 0.232 
IT 0.208 
Finance 0.184 
Sales 0.128 
Example: P(Employee in Marketing) = 0.248 
**Task 3 – Correlation Analysis**
Correlation between Marketing Spend and Units Sold = 0.1286 (Weak Positive). 

**Task 4 – Regression Analysis**
Regression Equation: Blood Pressure = 0.1014 × Age + 138.8149. Prediction for Age = 50 → 143.88 mmHg. 

**Task 5 – Hypothesis Testing (ANOVA)**
H0: All department salary means are equal. H1: At least one department has a different mean salary. p-value = 0.6807 → Fail to Reject H0.

**Final Insights**
The datasets show strong central tendencies, moderate variability, and weak correlations. Regression indicates a mild increase in BP with age. 
ANOVA confirms that salary differences across departments are statistically insignificant.
